	<h1>Jaelynn Ailina Diokno</h1>

		<p>This is the website of Jaelynn Ailina Diokno. I have no clue of what is going on in this class and website..</p>
		<p>I am a Communication Design major at California State University of Monterey Bay. I am currently a first-year freshman and still reside in San Jose, California.</p>
		<p>I enjoy simple activities such as playing games on my Nintendo Switch, baking cupcakes, cleaning my room, taking showers, and spending time with friends & my partner.</p>

		<p>This website is for my CTS 251 course, so expect boring stuff..</p>
